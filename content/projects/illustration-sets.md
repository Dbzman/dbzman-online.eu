This project consists of a Mac app and the according website. In 2013 my father and I had the idea to try a different solution for selling his illustrations. The outcome of this was this Mac app which includes different categories of his selected work. The website was done with Contao 3 and the Foundation 5 framework. As I needed this website quickly and I already had plenty of experience in using Contao the choice was clear. Foundation was chosen because I wanted to know how it compares to Bootstrap and I have to say that I haven't lost productivity during development. Over time there were only minor changes done to the website. The biggest one was upgrading Foundation from version 4 to 5. The website and app were discontinued in 2017 because we weren't able anymore to invest enough time in this project.
