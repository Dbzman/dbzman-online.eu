As my father is a graphic designer he someday wanted to have a website to show some of his work to customers. This project has always had Contao as the base (In the beginning it was even running on Typolight) and has slightly changed its design over the years. It consists just of the plain Contao core with no special frontend framework like Bootstrap since it was started many years ago and there was not a need to make it responsive yet.
