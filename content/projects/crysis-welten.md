When the first ingame footage of Crysis was spread over the internet I instantly knew that I wanted to get deeper into that topic so I started a community/fan website. First called Crysis-Lab and completely driven and hosted by myself (and using Joomla) it was later integrated into the OnlineWelten network where me and my team felt right at home. They sponsored us a big fileserver and a new CMS with a way better design. As we were not many people it became difficult to manage all new stuff (news, downloads, pictures) which flooded in every day. In the end we had to abandon the project but it was a wonderful experience. Now the domain doesn't even exist anymore.
