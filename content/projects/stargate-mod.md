The Stargate Mod is a Total Conversion of Half-Life 2. It was initially developed for the Unreal 2 engine. I jumped in when they made the switch to HL2 and have been working as a level designer and "Mapping Subleader". The map I was working on was called "Another Way". I carefully crafted it using blueprints of the Standford University which was the architectural inspiration for that planed called Tollana. (For those who know the series) The mod is still in development but sadly I do not have the time to contribute to it. Also my interests shifted over the years and moved away from game design more to the web and mobile world.
