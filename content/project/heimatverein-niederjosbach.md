This website has been done for a local history club I am also a member of. It has a rather long history and had switched it's foundation quite often. Starting with Joomla, over to Typolight (now known as Contao), to Wordpress and now Typo3. I've chosen Typo3 at the end because it was the most flexible solution for this case as it is providing good calendar, news and gallery solutions. Also Typo3 6.2 has a very deep Bootstrap integration which was also one of the main reasons for choosing it over Contao which I initially reconsidered as it is now also a really flexible, clean yet simple solution providing many great features. (Gallery support has improved a lot over the past years!) But since I wanted to try something new and also the company I work for currently is an expert in Typo3 I chose that.
