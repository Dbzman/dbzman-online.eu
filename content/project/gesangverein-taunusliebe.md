Another project for a local club. (singer club) Done with Bootstrap 3 and Contao 3. Before real development started I was long thinking about which CMS would fit best here. At the end Contao 3 was the system of choice since it was easy enough to use for the people maintaining the content. It has a very great gallery support, compared to some years ago, which is also quite important for this club. I also tried to optimize as much as possible for mobile devices. The fonts are generally a bit bigger than usual because the target audience mostly is of an older generation. It was also planned to include member areas where only internal information could be spread but for the initial version this was skipped because it was not needed for version 1. The main goal was to have at least a useful website live since this club has not had a website before.
