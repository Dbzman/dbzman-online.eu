The talk „personal productivity patterns“ by my colleague [Stefan Rotsch](https://twitter.com/ritschie) inspired me to overthink my personal behaviour and methods.
Although I’m practicing GTD for 7 years now, and more or less successfully, I am still not satisfied how some things work.
I thought what I could do to improve my routines or to tear away fear from certain ones. I have to admit I rely heavily on digital tools for this process. So the following might not be applicable to other tools or might not be a problem at all in a "offline world".

# My setup
I use OmniFocus to keep track of all my projects and tasks. It's my reliable inbox for all of that also because it syncs to all of my devices.
An issue I found was **how I used due dates**.

# Priority of certain tasks
Before we continue let's shortly look at how I prioritize tasks in OmniFocus:
{{< post_image "Priority" "/images/blog/2016/05/priority.png" >}}

## High
Tasks with due dates have the highest priority and ideally should be smallest amount of all available tasks.
The forecast perspective in OmniFocus shows me these kind of tasks.

## Medium
Flagged tasks have medium priority. When I find that there are now "due soon" or "overdue" tasks left I can work on tasks which are categorized "medium". I can find them in the "flagged" perspective in OmniFocus. They consist of tasks I want to tackle this week.

## Low
All other tasks.
They can be found using "contexts" or "projects" perspectives.

# Reasons for using due dates
A reason for placing a due date on a task is usually:
It as to be done **at certain point** or **not later** than that point.

# Problems when misusing them
I personally used "due dates" whenever I found an action which needed to be done in the future (for me doesn’t belong to the calendar because this doesn’t allow „checking“ it) and I want to be reminded about that later instead of having to worry that I may forget it if I sometimes forget to look into that tool.
Most of the time the tasks were important to be done **around that time but not critical to be done on that certain point** (and sometimes not possible) so this was clearly an issue because setting a due date does the following:

- The task appears in the forecast view when it's due soon
- I get a push notification and desktop notification when it's overdue
- Overdue tasks stay on the top of the forecast view and appear in red as long as you don't check them

I was using "due date tasks" for tasks which are more considered "timeframe tasks".
The problem was that there were naturally many tasks which need to be done during a specific timeframe (like calling a doctor after he’s back from vacation)
but a due date is not the right fit here because a due date expects that you do this task **at that specific time** and OmniFocus even shows you that a certain
task is overdue which means the task should’ve been done already and is of vital importance which can cause a feel of guilt.

So these kind of tasks just need to be popping in at the right point in time but are **not critical to solve at a specific time but rather within a timeframe.**  
Also adding a due date lowers the criticality psychology-wise due to the fact that you begin to ignore overdue or „due soon“ tasks.

# Make due dates important again
By accident I discovered a really nice function in OmniFocus: "defer until"  
If I have such "timeframe tasks" for the coming week I tend to **flag** them so they are placed in the "flagged" perspective which has a lower priority than the "forecast" perspective (which shows due and overdue tasks). The "flagged" perspective is a list I regularly visit to find current important but not critical tasks.
The "defer until" function perfectly assists me here. If I have such a task in about 3 weeks I flag this task.
But then this task immediately lands on the "flagged" list which is too much since I don’t want all "future important" tasks to be there for my current week.
So what I did was setting a „defer until“ date in 3 weeks.
This will

- remove the task from the "flagged" perspective
- show this task in the "flagged" perspective in 3 weeks (right when I need it)
- remove the task from any context

The 3rd one is really interesting because I have contexts which are location based. So imagine I have a „timeframe task“ in such a context.
I would be reminded **every time I pass this location** even if the task is not important yet.
Adding a „defer until“ date moves it away from there and puts it back right when I need it.

# Conclusion
If you’re using OmniFocus consider using „defer until“ for „timeframe tasks“ to not clutter your current lists and give the really important tasks their power back.
